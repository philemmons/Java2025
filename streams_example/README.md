# Stream Example

## Java Streams is a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that simplifies the processing of collections and sequences of data. Streams enable you to perform complex operations on data with concise and expressive code. In this article, weâ€™ll explore the basics of Java Streams in simple language, along with code examples to help beginners understand and use this feature.

### What Are Java Streams?

### In Java, a Stream is a sequence of data that you can process in a declarative and functional style. It allows you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing on a collection of data. Streams can be used with various data sources, including arrays, collections, and even I/O channels.

### The primary advantage of using Streams is that they abstract the underlying data and simplify the code for data manipulation. With Streams, you can create more readable and concise code, which makes your programs easier to understand and maintain.
