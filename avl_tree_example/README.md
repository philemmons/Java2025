# AVL Tree
## Self-Balancing Binary Tree - Generics

- The AVL tree implementation provided is a custom-written generic AVL tree in Java. It is based on standard AVL tree concepts, including height balancing, rotations, and insertion logic, which are widely available in data structure textbooks and online references. If you're looking for authoritative sources, you can refer to:

- Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS) – Covers AVL trees in detail.

- Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java by Mark A. Weiss – Explains AVL trees with Java examples.

- GeeksforGeeks (geeksforgeeks.org) – Offers similar AVL tree implementations in Java.
